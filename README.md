# üí¨ Talksy - Chat with your PDF using Azure OpenAI (Local Prototype)

Talksy is a basic Streamlit app that runs on your **local machine** and allows you to upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content.  
It uses **Azure OpenAI**, **LangChain**, and **FAISS** to extract and understand information from documents.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is an **early prototype**, not a complete production model, and is **not yet hosted online**.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload any PDF file
- Extracts and splits the text into chunks
- Generates vector embeddings using Azure OpenAI
- Stores data in FAISS for fast retrieval
- Answers your questions using LangChain QA chain
